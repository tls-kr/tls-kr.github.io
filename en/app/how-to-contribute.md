# How to contribute

### Setting up git and GitHub

The documentation is maintained separately from the other parts of the HXWD website.   Instead of your HXWD account, you will need [a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) to contribute to the HXWD Documentation.
If you are comfortable working with git and GitHub, you can skip ahead to [Contributing to the HXWD Docs](#contributing-to-hxwd).
If you've created a new GitHub account and want to know what to do next, you can choose one of the following ways to contribute changes:

- [GitHub UI](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-files) -
  This is the easiest way to contribute **small changes** described in [Simple changes](#simple-changes).
- [GitHub Desktop](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-desktop) - A desktop app for managing interaction with GitHub.
- [GitHub CLI](https://docs.github.com/en/github-cli/github-cli/about-github-cli) - A command-line wrapper for interacting with GitHub.
- [`git`](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - You can use `git` from the command line to interact with GitHub.
  The examples in this document assume you are using this method.
  The [`git` cheat sheet](https://training.github.com/) and [Using Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started) guide are useful resources for beginners and advanced users.

### Simple changes

If you want to make a small change like fixing a typo, the GitHub UI is the easiest way to get started.
If you've found a typo on the page [The results of a full text search](manual/search-results), for example, you can propose a fix as follows:

1. Sign in to [GitHub](https://github.com/)
2. Navigate to [https://github.com/tls-kr/tls-kr.github.io](https://github.com/tls-kr/tls-kr.github.io)
3. Find the source file, in this case `en/manual/search-results.md`
4. Click the edit (pencil) button

From there, the GitHub UI will walk you through the rest by creating a [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo) and a branch to commit your changes to.
After you have made changes to your branch, open a [pull request](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests) with your changes to be incorporated.

A pull request represents the work you want to be reviewed, approved, and merged into the `main` branch of the HXWD repository.
See the [Creating a pull request](#creating-a-pull-request) for more details on creating and handling pull requests successfully.

If you're not certain of the changes that you want to make, [get in touch with us](https://github.com/tls-kr/tls-kr.github.io/issues) by reporting the problem here!
