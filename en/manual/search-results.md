# The results of a full text search

![search results](/images/search-results.png)
## Explanation for the numbered sections
- ① The header line for the result display. The scope of the search, **texts** is shown in bold face, as well as the search term, **尚書大傳** in our example.
- ② The summary of results and links section:
	- Number of matches, details about the current display on this page. In this case, the display is set to 50 items per page (this default setting); since we have more than 50 items, there will be a navigation section at the end of the list of 50 items (not shown here), which will allow you to move to the next page.
	- There are additional display options, which depend on the type of search (see [Search types](search-types)) for more information, here we have for example "Click here to display matches tabulated by text".  "Click here to display all matches" on the other hand is not relevant and should not appear here.
	- This section offers also several links based on the search term.  For every character in the search term, a link to the [taxonomy of meanings](taxonomy-meanings) is offered, as well as one to the [phonetic profile](phonetic-profile). To help with a quick orientation, these links have backgrounds in different colors, this color will appear on all pages for this type of link. 
	- The following line has external links, with background in turquoise, the first two are to character dictionaries, followed by a word dictionary.
	- The last line offers to [sort the results](sort-results) differently -- the default is by text date, as far it is registered in the system.
- ③ The last of the external links (漢リポ) offers to search in the [Kanseki Repository](kanseki-repository), a sister project of the HXWD.
